# Project Description

In this project, I created two web projects using Maven and Gradle. Each project contains one JSP page that displays information about my first and last name and my joy to study at LOGOS IT ACADEMY.

## Technologies

I used the following technologies to develop my projects:

- Java
- Maven
- Gradle
- Servlets
- JSP
- Apache Tomcat
- Git and GitHub

### How to start a project

### Maven project

1. Clone the repository using `git clone [link_to_repository]`.
2. Navigate to the `maven-webapp` directory.
3. Edit the ``src/main/webapp/index.jsp` file with your first and last name.
4. Run the `mvn package` command to package the project into a WAR file.
5. Copy the resulting WAR file to the Tomcat `webapps` directory.
6. Start Tomcat and open a browser at `http://localhost:8080/maven-webapp`.

### Gradle project

1. Clone the repository using `git clone [link_to_repository]`.
2. Navigate to the `your-project` directory.
3. Edit the `src/main/webapp/index.jsp` file with your first and last name.
4. Run the `gradle build` command to package the project into a WAR file.
5. Copy the resulting WAR file to the Tomcat `webapps` directory.
6. Start Tomcat and open a browser at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Notes

These projects were created as part of the learning objectives for learning how to develop web applications using Java, Maven, and Gradle. They are examples of basic customizations and functionality that can be further developed and improved.
